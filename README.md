# iRacingFanboi
iRacing PWM speed based fan control
This project is comprised of two main parts each of which has been cobbled together from code from lots of different places.
The C# code (and associated executable) will run along side iRacing and read various telemetry data and pass that information 
onto the Arduino code which will run PWM fans.  You will need to look for information on using a Monster Moto shield to run your fans.
Richard Macnaughtan has a thread on the iRacing forum to explain how to do this http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3495614.page

This executable also allows you run your fans standalone at a user defined speed.
